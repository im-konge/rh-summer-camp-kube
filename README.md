# Kubernetes session

One of the sessions from the RedHat Summer Camp 2024, which focuses on Kubernetes and questions like:
- What is containerization?
- What is Kubernetes and why it is useful?
- How to deploy my app to Kubernetes?
- How to debug issues that I'm encountering on Kubernetes?

The session is split into three parts:

- Deployment of the application to Kubernetes
  - Uses application from the [Java Code session](https://github.com/see-quick/rh-summer/tree/main)
  - Alternatively you can use the updated application in the [application](application) folder
- Expose your application outside of Kubernetes cluster
- Debugging session
