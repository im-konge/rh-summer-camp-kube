# Deployment of the application to Kubernetes

The first practical part of the Kubernetes session.
It focuses on deployment of the application (that was implemented during Java Code session).
In case that you don't have the application implemented from the Code session, you can use the one from 
the [application](../application) folder - which is updated version of https://github.com/see-quick/rh-summer/tree/main/_03-spring-http-server/src/main/java/io/http/end.
